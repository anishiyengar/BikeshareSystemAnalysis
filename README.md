# BikeshareSystemAnalysis
This project used Data Science tools to analyze the effectiveness and intended use of the Bikeshare system in Boston.
• Devised a program that used different datasets and metrics to analyze bike share efficiency in Boston
• Parsing large datasets and APIs from Hubway, Boston.gov, Mass.gov, and various information to analyze the presence of
bike stations and availabilities in lower income areas
• Using Google’s Reverse Geocoding API and clustering to devise results that plot trends in station locations in various Boston
neighborhoods
• Ultimate goal to propose new effective methods and improvements that can be made to the Boston BikeShare system to
enable access for all groups of people, ethnicities, and neighborhoods in Boston
• Tech/Tool Stack: Python, SciPy and NumPy libraries, Google Geocoding API
